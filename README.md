# Bikesharing

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to create several visualizations on bikesharing data utilizing tableau. The end result is a story to present to investors on whie a bikesharing program could be advantageous to introduce into the Des Moines transportation market. 

## Results

The above graph is one of seven visualizations created for this challenge. It shows ride duration split by gender. The bike share program is most often used for rides of short duration (5-6 minutes being the most common duration for men and women) not many people use the bikes for rides longer than an hour. This means if we were to introduce the bike share to Des Moines, we would need to be sure the bikes were in a centrally located area where there is high traffic and close proximity.

This is a heat map that shows times the bikes are most used over the week. People are most likely to use the bikes around 8 in the morning on weekdays, and again at 5pm. This corresponds to typical work hours, which are high-traffic times in any city. The idea here that having bike shares in areas where working individuals have ease of access could make the bike share preferable to other transportation methods during this time.

Finally, this is a second heat map that adds the gender variable to the prior heat map. It shows when men and women are most likely to use the bikes. Both are more likely to use bikes during typical high-traffic hours (8am and 5pm) though the map shows that men are far more likely to use the service than women. 

## Summary 

Preliminary data visualization shows a promising trend for bike sharing in New York, and could see similar success in Des Moines. There are two additional visualizations I would suggest prior to moving forward, first examining trip duration by starting point. Understanding where our longest and shortest rides occur gives us more information about the type of environment our consumers need for the bike share to be successful. The average riders do not use the bikes for trips longer than 5-10 minutes, so knowing where longer trips are occurring could be benifical for placing bikes in Des Moines. Another visualization would be to look at most popular stops throughout the week by hour. For the same reason as above, it would be highly beneficial when placing bike stations to know where there are high population densities of workers that utilize the bikes as a method of travel. A third possible visualization that would rely on outside data would be to create a map that shows popular stops overlapped with access to other modes of transportation, comparing bike stations to subway lines or taxi services.
